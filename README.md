## Inspiration
The inspiration for Stealth Startup came from the idea of automating the entire process of building a company. We wanted to create intelligent agents that simulate the roles of a CEO, CTO, and Marketer, each contributing to building out a startup from scratch, mirroring the experience of launching a real-world tech startup and seeing how a particular idea would play out in a given market.

## What it does
We were able to create the first fully self-functioning startup run purely by AI, there's no human interaction to re-iterate the business plan, refactor some of the code, or even change up the colors on the logo AI-generated — it's the agents that are 100% in control of the iteration of all aspects of the startup. Stealth Startup is a simulation platform where AI agents act as key team member agents—CEO, CTO, and Marketer—who collaboratively build a startup. The CEO agent handles market research, generates business strategies, and designs the business plan — note that we connected it to the web to get the latest insights. The CTO agent directly modifies the codebase and pushes updates to a real GitHub repository — it's able to go through the entire codebase of the startup the agents are building, make actual changes to the code, and commit these changes to their personal repository. The Marketer agent designs and creates logos and branding materials for the startup — it's able to literally generate relevant logos based on the startup idea and iterate on the design based on consulting with the other agents. These AI agents communicate on Slack wherein they can have discussions between team members and provide updates to one another in various channels. The agents came together and ended up building a 911 dispatch assistant web application built fully in React by the CTO agent.
